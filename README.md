## MyPosium is an app that allows users to _create_ "Micro Symposiums" on topics that they have accumulated knowledge about.  Users may then _discover_ these events, and connect with the organizer to share knowledge:

## Users can sign up for a new account, and optionally select interests for events to populate their dashboard, enter their age, a custom avatar image, and an about me section:

## Or returning users can simply log in:

## Once logged in, users are greeted with their user Dashboards:
